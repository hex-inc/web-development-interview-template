# Hex Web Development Interview

## Overview

Welcome to the Hex Web Development Interview! During the interview session, you'll use this boilerplate repository to build out a frontend application with your interviewer.

## Before the interview

Before the interview, please make sure you have Node.js v16+ installed on your machine as well as yarn or npm. Then, make sure you can build and run the (very simple) app provided as follows:

1) First, install dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm`).
2) Run `yarn dev` (or `npm dev`). The app will start and your terminal will tell you what URL to go to in order to view the app. The app will hot reload as you make changes.

If using VSCode, we highly recommend installing [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) or other code formatting extensions to reduce time formatting code.
