# Hex Web Development Interview

## Overview

Welcome to the Hex Web Development Interview! During the interview session, you'll use this boilerplate repository to build out a frontend application with your interviewer.

## Before the interview

Before the interview, please make sure you have Node.js v16+ installed on your machine as well as yarn or npm. Then, make sure you can build and run the (very simple) app provided as follows:

1) First, install dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm`).
2) Run `yarn dev` (or `npm dev`). The app will start and your terminal will tell you what URL to go to in order to view the app. The app will hot reload as you make changes.
